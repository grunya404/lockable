f you want to interact with the underlying mongo db run mongo from the command line (with mongod running). Use the show dbs command to see the database cube has created for you (the default is cube_development). Then use the use DB_NAME command to switch to that db (for example use cube_development ). Once in, use show collections to see the collection cube created. If you wanted to say, count the number of records it would look something like db.MY_DB_NAME.count() . See mongo’s documentation for more shell commands, basic NoSQL and so forth.
